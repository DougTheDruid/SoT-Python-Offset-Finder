# New 2.0 SDK & finder
This finder only works with my SDKs, not a standard C++ SDK

3 versions for your liking, all using the exact same source data:
1) Fake-CPP - Literally generated by concatenating strings and formatting the json version differently
2) JSON - Superior to all others
3) YAML - For masochists who prefer it
